# Book Search Engine

## Description

In this project, I worked with existing code provided by The Coding Bootcamp on GitLab. I was motivated to refactor the existing code to a MERN application.

Through the implementation of various development packages, as well as changing the way data is collected, I was able to modify the code to create a MERN application that works the same as the code originally provided.



[Here is the URL of the deployed application](https://nameless-sea-52554-0d5e5ed49205.herokuapp.com/). (currently Application Error)

The usage of the application is simple. Simply use the search bar to search for books!
There’s an additional option to create an account to save the books you’re interested in.
